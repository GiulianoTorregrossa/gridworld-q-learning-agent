# Q-Learning in Gridworld

## Description
This project implements a Q-learning algorithm in a simple grid-world environment using Python. It's designed to demonstrate the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, specifically the Q-learning technique, in a clear and accessible way.

## Features
- Implementation of Q-learning algorithm.
- Customizable grid-world environment.
- Parametric starting and goal positions for the agent.
- Exploration vs. exploitation trade-off in learning.

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy

## Setup and Installation
1. Ensure Python (version 3.x or above) is installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/GiulianoTorregrossa/gridworld-q-learning-agent.git
   ```
3. Install necessary dependencies (if any):
   ```
   pip install numpy
   ```

## Usage
Run the main script to start the training process of the Q-learning agent in the grid-world environment:
```
python main.py
```
